# Physical Description (Early Clusters, 1984-1896)
The cluster is designed in a highly modular fashion which will dramatically ease the process. Most of the Vacuum Fluorescent Displays (VFDs) are located on a single PCB, along with their driver ICs. The trip meter display and driver is located on an additional sub-module. The mechanical odometer is an additional sub-module. The processor board is similar in footprint to the main display board, and is connected to the display board by two, twenty-by-one JAE terminal strips, and is mechanically fastened by 4 fasteners in the middle of the boards and several more along the perimeter. The processor board connects to the car by two Sumitomo 58S-series wire-to-wire connectors, totalling 32 contacts (31 used). The processor board also connects to a power supply module via two AMP(?) wire-to-board connectors, totalling 28 contacts (though not all are used).
