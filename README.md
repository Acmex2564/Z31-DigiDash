# Z31-DigiDash
Reverse Engineering of the 300zx (Z31) Digital Cluster &amp; Design of replacement PCBs

Z31 digital clusters are one of, if not the best examples of this pure 1980s trend. Comprehensive instrumentation, large graphics, and gorgeous VFD illumination were a somewhat expensive option on the 300zx, as well as on Maxima, 240SX, Corvette, Celica/Supra, and a variety of other cars. As the cars languished in the transition period between "late model" and "classic", though, the digital package for the 300zx was not well liked.

It had 3 major issues:

Terrible update speed

Lack of brightness

Unreliability

Now, as Z31s sit at the bottom of the depreciation curve, more people see them as '80s Grand Touring icons and not just as transporation or "sports cars", and a functioning digital dash can be a highlight instead of a detractor.

I have the personal goal of solving at least two of the 3 main problems with these units, by reverse engineering them in the existing state, and designing a drop-on processor board and replacement power supply module. 

See files "Physical Description.md", "Logical Description.md", and "Electrical Description.md" for my observations so far. Also present are images showing how to power up the dash out of the car, and a picture of a printout that I used to map out the input pins.

Note: I am a hobbiest. I am not a EE, CS, Developer, or any related field. Generally, I do my best to read and cargo-cult my way into a working solution. Progress will be slow. The modular design has made it easy to get quick progress and seize control of the actual display, so input, input protection, and power supply will be the main challenges.
